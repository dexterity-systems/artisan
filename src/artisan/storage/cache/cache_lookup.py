"""Delta Lake execution cache lookup.

Query the executions table for a previous successful run with the same
deterministic execution_spec_id. On a cache hit the caller skips
execution entirely and reuses existing artifacts.

Complements the file-based cache in ``execution/cache_validation.py``,
which validates a specific sandbox directory. This module performs a
global lookup across all prior executions.

    Query the executions Delta table for a prior successful run matching

    Args:
        executions_path: URI/path to the executions Delta table.
        execution_spec_id: Deterministic ID computed from operation,
            inputs, and merged params.

        storage_options: Credentials/config passed to delta-rs calls.

            If None, inferred from ``executions_path`` by navigating two
            levels up to the delta root.
