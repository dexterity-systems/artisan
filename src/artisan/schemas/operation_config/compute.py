    The container image must have artisan installed (transport

    Attributes:
        image: Container image for the Modal function.
        gpu: GPU type (e.g. "A10G", "A100", "H100").
        memory_gb: Container memory in GB.
        timeout: Per-call timeout in seconds.
        retries: Number of retries on preemption.
        min_containers: Containers kept warm even at zero traffic.
            Set to match expected batch parallelism to eliminate
            cold starts. 0 means scale-to-zero (Modal default).
        scaledown_window: Seconds a container idles before shutdown.
            None uses Modal's default (60s). Max 1200s.
        image_registry_secret: Name of a Modal Secret (created via
            ``modal secret create ...``) carrying ``REGISTRY_USERNAME``
            and ``REGISTRY_PASSWORD`` for pulling private images. None
            (default) pulls without authentication; set when ``image``
            points at a private registry.
        local_python_sources: Top-level Python package names to overlay
            onto the Modal image via
            ``modal.Image.add_local_python_source``. The default
            ``["artisan"]`` preserves the existing behavior of shipping
            the dev-host artisan source live, shadowing whatever version
            the image pip-installed. Add your own package name(s) to
            also overlay project sources live
            (e.g. ``["artisan", "pipelines"]``). Remove ``"artisan"`` to
            use the image's pinned version instead; pass ``[]`` to
            overlay nothing. Mounted at cold-start rather than baked
            into the image — upload bandwidth scales with total source
            size.
