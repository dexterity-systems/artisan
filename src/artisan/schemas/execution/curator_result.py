"""Result models returned by curator operations.

Curator operations return one of two shapes:
- ``ArtifactResult`` -- creates new draft artifacts.
- ``PassthroughResult`` -- routes existing artifact IDs.

The ``CuratorResult`` union captures both for typing and validation.

    """Result from curator operations that create new artifacts.

    These operations produce draft artifacts from their inputs. Drafts have
    ``artifact_id=None`` and are finalized by the framework before staging.

    Attributes:
        success: Whether execution completed successfully.
        error: Error message if success is False.
        artifacts: Output role -> draft artifact list.
            e.g. {"data": [DataArtifact(...), ...]}
        lineage: Optional explicit lineage declarations per role.
            If None, framework infers lineage from output specs.
        metadata: Extensibility escape hatch for additional data.

            artifacts. When None or empty, no edges are staged.
        metadata: Extensibility escape hatch for additional data.
