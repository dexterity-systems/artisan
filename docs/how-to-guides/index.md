# How-to Guides

Task-oriented instructions for common Artisan framework operations. Each guide follows a consistent format: prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, and a verification step to confirm success.

## Operations

- [Writing Creator Operations](writing-creator-operations.md) -- Build
  operations that produce new artifacts
- [Writing Curator Operations](writing-curator-operations.md) -- Build
  operations that filter, merge, or transform collections
- [Writing Composite Operations](writing-composite-operations.md) -- Group
  tightly coupled operations into reusable composites
- [Creating Artifact Types](creating-artifact-types.md) -- Define custom
  artifact types for your domain

## Pipelines

- [Building a Pipeline](building-a-pipeline.md) -- Create, wire, and execute
  a pipeline from scratch

## Configuration

- [Configuring Execution](configuring-execution.md) -- Resource allocation,
  batching, and SLURM configuration
- [Configuring S3-Compatible Storage](configuring-s3.md) -- Point Delta
  Lake, staging, and inputs at S3, MinIO, or any S3-compatible backend
- [Connect to Prefect](connect-to-prefect.md) -- Connect pipelines to Prefect
  for monitoring

## Results

- [Inspecting Provenance](inspecting-provenance.md) -- Query lineage and trace
  artifact history
- [Exporting Results](exporting-results.md) -- Extract data from Delta tables
  and export artifacts
