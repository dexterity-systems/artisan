# Configure Execution

How to control where operations run, what resources they get, and how work
is batched — from local development through production SLURM.

**Prerequisites:** [Operations Model](../concepts/operations-model.md),
[Building a Pipeline](building-a-pipeline.md)

**Key types:** `Backend`, `ResourceConfig`, `ExecutionConfig`, `ToolSpec`,
`Environments`, `CachePolicy`, `FailurePolicy`, `Compute`, `ModalComputeConfig`

---

## Minimal working example

A pipeline running one step locally and one on SLURM with GPU resources:

```python
from artisan.orchestration import Backend, PipelineManager
from myops import PreprocessOp, InferenceOp

pipeline = PipelineManager.create(
    name="example",
    delta_root="runs/delta",
    staging_root="runs/staging",
)

pipeline.run(operation=PreprocessOp, name="preprocess", params={"count": 100})

pipeline.run(
    operation=InferenceOp,
    name="inference",
    inputs={"dataset": pipeline.output("preprocess", "dataset")},
    step_runner=Runner.SLURM,
    resources={"gpus": 1, "memory_gb": 32, "extra": {"partition": "gpu"}},
    execution={"artifacts_per_unit": 1},
)
```

The rest of this guide breaks down each option.

---

## Choose a compute backend

Every step runs on a compute backend. Set it per step or as a pipeline-wide
default:

```python
from artisan.orchestration import Backend

# Pipeline-wide default
pipeline = PipelineManager.create(..., step_runner=Runner.SLURM)

# Step-level override
pipeline.run(operation=MyOp, inputs=..., step_runner=Runner.LOCAL)
```

| Backend | How it runs | When to use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `Runner.LOCAL` (default) | Process pool on your machine | Development, testing, lightweight ops |
| `Runner.SLURM` | SLURM job array on cluster | Production, GPU work, HPC |
| `Runner.SLURM_INTRA` | srun within existing SLURM allocation | Interactive salloc sessions, zero queue wait |

For `SLURM_INTRA`, you must be inside an existing SLURM allocation
(`salloc` or `sbatch`). Work is distributed via `srun` with no queue wait:

```python
pipeline.run(
    operation=MyOp,
    inputs=...,
    step_runner=Runner.SLURM_INTRA,
    resources={"gpus": 1, "cpus": 4, "memory_gb": 16},
)
```

For `LOCAL`, you can cap the number of concurrent workers per step:

```python
pipeline.run(operation=MyOp, inputs=..., execution={"max_workers": 8})
```

The default process pool size is 4.

---

## Configure compute routing

Compute routing controls where the execute() phase runs, independently of
the dispatch backend. Set it per step or as a pipeline-wide default:

```python
from artisan.schemas.operation_config.compute import Compute, ModalComputeConfig

# Pipeline-wide default
pipeline = PipelineManager.create(..., default_compute_provider="local")

# Step-level override (string shorthand)
pipeline.run(operation=MyOp, inputs=..., compute_provider="modal")

# Step-level override (dict with inline config)
pipeline.run(
    operation=MyOp,
    inputs=...,
    compute={"active": "modal", "modal": {"gpu": "A100", "memory_gb": 32}},
)
```

| Compute target | How it runs | When to use |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| `"local"` (default) | Direct call inside the worker | Development, testing, CPU-only ops |
| `"modal"` | Route to a Modal container | GPU work, cloud burst, isolated environments |

### ModalComputeConfig fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `image` | `str` | (required) | Container image for the Modal function |
| `gpu` | `str \| None` | `None` | GPU type (e.g. `"T4"`, `"A100"`, `"H100"`) |
| `memory_gb` | `int` | `8` | Container memory in GB |
| `timeout` | `int` | `3600` | Per-call timeout in seconds |
| `retries` | `int` | `3` | Retries on preemption |

The container image must have artisan installed. Transport functions run
inside the container.

### Validating operations for remote compute

Use `validate_remote_execute()` in your test suite to catch serialization
issues before they reach production:

```python
from artisan.execution.compute import validate_remote_execute

op = MyOperation()
assert validate_remote_execute(op)  # checks cloudpickle + tool paths
```

The validator checks two things:

- **Cloudpickle round-trip:** serializes and deserializes the operation
  instance. Fails if the operation has unpicklable attributes (file handles,
  lambdas, etc.).
- **ToolSpec path check:** warns if `tool.executable` points to a local-only
  absolute path that won't exist on the remote container.

### Transport limits

File-based operations transport sandbox files to and from the remote
container. The transport limit is 50 MB per direction. For larger data,
put files on object storage (S3, GCS) and pass URIs as operation
parameters.

Python scripts referenced by ToolSpec are shipped automatically. External
binaries (compiled tools) must be pre-installed in the container image.

---

## Configure resources

Pass a `resources` dict to override resource allocation for a step:

```python
pipeline.run(
    operation=MyOp,
    inputs=...,
    step_runner=Runner.SLURM,
    resources={
        "gpus": 1,
        "memory_gb": 32,
        "time_limit": "04:00:00",
        "cpus": 4,
        "extra": {"partition": "gpu"},
    },
)
```

### ResourceConfig fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `cpus` | `int` | `1` | CPU cores per task |
| `memory_gb` | `int` | `4` | Memory in GB |
| `gpus` | `int` | `0` | Number of GPUs requested |
| `time_limit` | `str` | `"01:00:00"` | Wall-clock time limit (HH:MM:SS) |
| `extra` | `dict` | `{}` | Backend-specific settings (e.g., `{"partition": "gpu"}`) |

`ResourceConfig` is portable across backends — each backend translates these
fields to its native format. Use `extra` for backend-specific settings like
SLURM partition or account.

Step-level `resources` merge with operation defaults — you only need to specify
the fields you want to override.

---

## Control batching

Batching determines how many artifacts each worker processes. This is the main
lever for tuning throughput.

```python
pipeline.run(
    operation=MyOp,
    inputs=...,
    execution={"artifacts_per_unit": 10},
)
```

With 100 input artifacts and `artifacts_per_unit=10`, the framework creates
10 execution units, each processing a batch of 10 artifacts.

### Two-level batching

Batching happens at two levels:

```
100 artifacts
    │
    │  artifacts_per_unit = 10
    ▼
10 execution units (logical work packages)
    │
    │  units_per_worker = 2
    ▼
5 SLURM jobs (each runs 2 units sequentially)
```

**Level 1 — `artifacts_per_unit`**: How many artifacts each execution unit
processes. Set this based on your operation's workload: 1 for GPU inference
(one artifact per job), 50–100 for fast metrics calculations.

**Level 2 — `units_per_worker`**: How many execution units a single SLURM job
runs sequentially. Use this to amortize job startup overhead without changing
your operation's batch logic.

### ExecutionConfig fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `artifacts_per_unit` | `int` | `1` | Artifacts per execution unit |
| `units_per_worker` | `int` | `1` | Execution units per SLURM job |
| `max_workers` | `int \| None` | `None` | Cap on concurrent workers |
| `max_artifacts_per_unit` | `int \| None` | `None` | Upper bound on artifacts per unit when using adaptive batching |
| `estimated_seconds` | `float \| None` | `None` | Expected wall-clock time per unit, used for scheduler hints |
| `job_name` | `str \| None` | `None` | Custom SLURM job name (defaults to operation name) |

---

## Set operation-level defaults

Operations can declare their own default resources and execution config so you
don't repeat the same overrides at every step:

```python
from artisan.operations.base import OperationDefinition
from artisan.schemas.operation_config.resource_config import ResourceConfig
from artisan.schemas.execution.execution_config import ExecutionConfig


class GpuInference(OperationDefinition):
    name = "gpu_inference"

    resources: ResourceConfig = ResourceConfig(
        gpus=1,
        memory_gb=32,
        time_limit="02:00:00",
        extra={"partition": "gpu"},
    )

    execution: ExecutionConfig = ExecutionConfig(
        artifacts_per_unit=1,
        estimated_seconds=600.0,
    )

    # ... lifecycle methods ...
```

Step-level overrides merge on top of these defaults. For example, to give a
specific step more memory without changing other settings:

```python
pipeline.run(operation=GpuInference, inputs=..., resources={"memory_gb": 64})
# gpus, time_limit, extra keep their operation defaults
```

### Override precedence

```
Pipeline defaults (PipelineManager.create)
    └── Operation defaults (class fields)
            └── Step overrides (pipeline.run kwargs)   ← wins
```

---

## Configure external tools and environments

Operations that wrap external tools declare two things: a `ToolSpec` (the
binary/script to invoke) and an `Environments` configuration (the runtime
that wraps the command):

```python
from pathlib import Path
from artisan.operations.base import OperationDefinition
from artisan.schemas.operation_config.tool_spec import ToolSpec
from artisan.schemas.operation_config.environments import Environments
from artisan.schemas.operation_config.environment_spec import ApptainerEnvironmentSpec


class ToolAOp(OperationDefinition):
    name = "tool_a"

    tool: ToolSpec = ToolSpec(
        executable=Path("run_tool_a.sh"),
        interpreter="bash",
    )

    environments: Environments = Environments(
        active="apptainer",
        apptainer=ApptainerEnvironmentSpec(
            image=Path("/tools/tool_a.sif"),
            gpu=True,
            binds=[
                (Path("/data/weights"), Path("/weights")),
                (Path("/scratch"), Path("/scratch")),
            ],
        ),
    )

    # ... lifecycle methods ...
```

Override tool or environment settings at the step level:

```python
pipeline.run(
    operation=ToolAOp,
    inputs=...,
    tool={"executable": "run_tool_a_v2.sh"},
    environment={"apptainer": {"image": "/tools/tool_a_v2.sif"}},
)
```

When you pass a dict for `environment`, fields are deep-merged with the
operation's existing environment config. This means partial overrides work
without discarding other fields. To switch the active environment without
changing any spec fields, pass a string instead:

```python
pipeline.run(operation=ToolAOp, inputs=..., environment="local")
```

The `binds` field takes a list of `(host_path, container_path)` tuples — not
colon-delimited strings.

### ToolSpec fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `executable` | `str \| Path` | (required) | Path or name of the binary/script. Resolved via PATH if not absolute. |
| `interpreter` | `str \| None` | `None` | Interpreter prefix (e.g., `"bash"`, `"python -u"`) |
| `subcommand` | `str \| None` | `None` | Subcommand inserted after the executable |

### Environment spec types

| Spec | Use case | Key fields |
|------|----------|------------|
| `ApptainerEnvironmentSpec` | Apptainer/Singularity containers (HPC) | `image` (Path), `gpu`, `binds` |
| `DockerEnvironmentSpec` | Docker containers | `image` (str), `gpu`, `binds` |
| `LocalEnvironmentSpec` | Local execution, optional virtualenv | `venv_path` |
| `PixiEnvironmentSpec` | Pixi-managed environments | `pixi_environment`, `manifest_path` |

All specs share a base `EnvironmentSpec` with an `env` dict for extra
environment variables.

## Set failure policy

Control what happens when some artifacts fail within a step:

```python
from artisan.schemas.enums import FailurePolicy

# Pipeline-wide default
pipeline = PipelineManager.create(..., failure_policy=FailurePolicy.CONTINUE)

# Step-level override
pipeline.run(operation=MyOp, inputs=..., failure_policy=FailurePolicy.FAIL_FAST)
```

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `FailurePolicy.CONTINUE` (default) | Commit successful artifacts, record failures, continue pipeline |
| `FailurePolicy.FAIL_FAST` | Stop the step immediately on any failure |

`CONTINUE` is the default because in large runs (thousands of artifacts), a
single malformed input should not discard thousands of successful results.
Failures are always recorded for diagnosis.

---

## Set cache policy

Cache policy controls when a previously completed step qualifies as a cache
hit on re-run (e.g., when resuming a pipeline):

```python
from artisan.schemas.enums import CachePolicy

pipeline = PipelineManager.create(..., cache_policy=CachePolicy.STEP_COMPLETED)
```

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `CachePolicy.ALL_SUCCEEDED` (default) | Cache hit only when the step had zero execution failures |
| `CachePolicy.STEP_COMPLETED` | Cache hit for any completed step, regardless of execution failure count |

Both policies block caching when infrastructure errors (dispatch or commit
failures) occurred. The difference is whether partial-failure steps count as
hits.

Use `STEP_COMPLETED` when you want to skip re-running a step that mostly
succeeded, even if a few artifacts failed.

---

## Use non-blocking execution

`pipeline.run()` blocks until the step completes. For steps that can overlap
(e.g., independent branches), use `pipeline.submit()` to dispatch without
waiting:

```python
future = pipeline.submit(
    operation=BranchAOp,
    inputs={"data": pipeline.output("preprocess", "data")},
    step_runner=Runner.SLURM,
)

# Submit another step concurrently
pipeline.submit(
    operation=BranchBOp,
    inputs={"data": pipeline.output("preprocess", "data")},
    step_runner=Runner.SLURM,
)

# Downstream steps that depend on a submitted step automatically wait
pipeline.run(
    operation=MergeOp,
    inputs={
        "a": pipeline.output("branch_a", "result"),
        "b": pipeline.output("branch_b", "result"),
    },
)
```

`submit()` returns a `StepFuture`. The orchestrator tracks dependencies and
blocks downstream steps until their inputs are ready.

---

## Common patterns

### Development: inspectable sandboxes

During development, you can make the working directory visible and persistent:

```python
pipeline = PipelineManager.create(
    ...,
    working_root="runs/working",
    preserve_working=True,
)
```

This writes sandboxes to `runs/working/` instead of `$TMPDIR` and keeps them
after execution completes, so you can inspect input materialization and output
files.

For production, omit `working_root` — the default uses `$TMPDIR` (typically
node-local SSD on SLURM clusters), which avoids shared filesystem contention.

### Debugging: preserve staging files

```python
pipeline = PipelineManager.create(..., preserve_staging=True)
```

Keeps the raw Parquet files workers produce before commit. Useful for diagnosing
staging or commit issues.

### Recovering from crashes

By default, `PipelineManager.create` commits leftover staging files from prior
crashed runs at pipeline initialization (`recover_staging=True`). To disable
this:

```python
pipeline = PipelineManager.create(..., recover_staging=False)
```

### Naming steps

By default, each step is named after the operation. Provide a custom `name` to
disambiguate when the same operation appears multiple times:

```python
pipeline.run(operation=ScoreOp, name="score_round1", inputs=...)
pipeline.run(operation=ScoreOp, name="score_round2", inputs=...)

# Reference by name
pipeline.output("score_round1", "scores")
```

### Tuning SLURM throughput

For operations with fast per-artifact execution (< 1 second), increase
`artifacts_per_unit` to reduce job overhead:

```python
pipeline.run(
    operation=FastMetrics,
    inputs=...,
    step_runner=Runner.SLURM,
    execution={"artifacts_per_unit": 100, "units_per_worker": 5},
)
```

For GPU operations, keep `artifacts_per_unit=1` and let SLURM handle
parallelism via job arrays.

### Custom SLURM parameters

Use `extra` for backend-specific parameters not covered by `ResourceConfig`:

```python
pipeline.run(
    operation=MyOp,
    inputs=...,
    resources={
        "extra": {
            "partition": "gpu",
            "constraint": "a100",
            "account": "my_allocation",
            "exclude": "node[001-003]",
        }
    },
)
```

### Disabling Delta Lake compaction

Each `run()` call compacts Delta Lake tables after commit. To skip compaction
(useful when running many small steps in sequence):

```python
pipeline.run(operation=MyOp, inputs=..., compact=False)
```

## Common pitfalls

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| SLURM jobs OOM-killed | Default `memory_gb=4` too low | Set `resources={"memory_gb": 32}` or add to operation defaults |
| Thousands of tiny SLURM jobs | `artifacts_per_unit=1` on a fast operation | Increase `artifacts_per_unit` to batch work |
| `binds` validation error | Using `"/host:/container"` strings | Use tuple pairs: `[("/host", "/container")]` |
| Step ignores `resources` | Forgot `step_runner=Runner.SLURM` | Resources only apply to SLURM steps |
| Workers contend on shared filesystem | Default `working_root` on NFS | Omit `working_root` — default uses `$TMPDIR` (node-local) |
| GPU/extra resource warning on local | SLURM-specific resources on `Runner.LOCAL` | These are ignored locally — switch to `Runner.SLURM` or remove them |

---

## Verify

Confirm your configuration works by running a small test:

```python
step = pipeline.run(operation=MyOp, inputs=..., step_runner=Runner.LOCAL)
assert step.success
print(f"Processed {step.succeeded_count} artifacts")
```

Then switch to `Runner.SLURM` for production. Check SLURM job logs if
failures occur — the job name format is `s{step_number}_{operation_name}`.
