# Orientation

This page explains the mental model behind Artisan — how the
documentation is organized and the five key abstractions you will encounter
throughout.

---

## How these docs are organized

The documentation provides four kinds of content, each designed for a different
situation:

| Kind | When to use it | What you'll find |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| **Tutorials** | "I want to learn" | Interactive notebooks that walk you through complete examples step by step. Start here if you're new. |
| **How-to Guides** | "I need to do X" | Focused recipes for specific tasks. Assumes you already know the basics. |
| **Concepts** | "I want to understand why" | Design decisions, mental models, and architecture. No code to run — explanation only. |
| **Reference** | "I need to look something up" | API signatures, schema tables, parameter lists. Structured for quick lookup, not reading. |

These four kinds are kept separate on purpose. Tutorials don't stop to explain
architecture. How-to guides don't teach theory. Reference pages don't include
design rationale. When you need context that isn't on the page you're reading,
you'll find a link to the right place.

> **Rule of thumb:** Start with **Tutorials** to build intuition, reach for
> **How-to Guides** when you have a concrete task, read **Concepts** when
> something feels like magic, and consult **Reference** when you need exact
> details.

## Five key abstractions

### Artifacts

An **artifact** is a content-addressed data node. The framework computes a
unique ID from the artifact's content (`xxh3_128` hash), so identical content
always produces the same ID. This enables automatic deduplication and
deterministic caching. Artifacts follow a draft/finalize pattern: drafts are
mutable while being assembled, and once finalized the content hash makes any
tampering detectable.

Artisan provides four built-in artifact types:

| Type | Class | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `DATA` | `DataArtifact` | Tabular data (CSV content stored as bytes) |
| `METRIC` | `MetricArtifact` | Computed measurements (JSON-serializable key-value pairs) |
| `CONFIG` | `BatchStrategyArtifact` | Execution configuration snapshots (JSON) |
| `FILE_REF` | `FileRefArtifact` | References to files at their original paths on disk |

Custom artifact types can be registered by domain layers through the
`ArtifactTypeDef` registry.

### Operations

An **operation** is a Python class that consumes artifacts and produces
artifacts. Operations declare typed input and output specifications via
`InputSpec` and `OutputSpec`, and know nothing about orchestration or
infrastructure.

There are two kinds:

- **Creator operations** run computation (external tools, GPU work) in a
  three-phase lifecycle — `preprocess`, `execute`, `postprocess` — each running
  in its own filesystem-isolated working directory.
- **Curator operations** perform metadata work (filtering, merging,
  ingesting) in a single `execute_curator` method call, skipping sandboxing
  entirely.

The framework ships with example creators (`DataGenerator`, `DataTransformer`,
`MetricCalculator`) and built-in curators (`Filter`, `Merge`, `IngestFiles`,
`IngestData`, `IngestPipelineStep`). There is also an `InteractiveFilter` tool
for exploratory filtering in notebooks, though it is not a pipeline operation.

When operations are tightly coupled — for example, always running transform
immediately followed by scoring — you can bundle them into a **composite**.
A `CompositeDefinition` declares its own inputs and outputs and wires
internal operations together via a `compose()` method, creating a reusable
building block that the pipeline can execute as a single step (collapsed)
or as separate steps (expanded).

### Pipelines

A **pipeline** is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of steps. You build one by
calling `pipeline.run()` to execute steps and `pipeline.output(name, role)` to
wire outputs from earlier steps into inputs of later ones. `PipelineManager`
handles dispatch, caching, and atomic commits.

```python
from artisan.orchestration import PipelineManager
from artisan.operations.examples import DataGenerator, DataTransformer

pipeline = PipelineManager.create(
    name="example",
    delta_root="runs/delta",
    staging_root="runs/staging",
)
output = pipeline.output

pipeline.run(DataGenerator, name="generate", params={"count": 4})
pipeline.run(
    DataTransformer,
    name="transform",
    inputs={"dataset": output("generate", "datasets")},
)
result = pipeline.finalize()
```

Each `run()` call executes a step, and `output("step_name", "role")` creates a
lazy reference that connects one step's outputs to another step's inputs. Steps
can run on different backends — `"local"` for in-process execution or
`"slurm"` for cluster dispatch — configured per-pipeline or per-step.

### Provenance

The framework captures **dual provenance** automatically:

- **Execution provenance** records what computation happened — which operation
  ran, when, with what parameters, and whether it succeeded.
- **Artifact provenance** records which input artifacts produced which output
  artifacts, forming a derivation graph across the entire pipeline.

You never need to wire provenance manually. Each operation declares lineage
relationships through `infer_lineage_from` on its output specs, and the
framework resolves them at runtime using filename stem matching to pair inputs
with outputs.

### Storage

All pipeline data lives in **Delta Lake** tables, giving you ACID transactions,
time travel, and efficient queries via Polars. Artifact content is stored
directly in Delta table columns — binary bytes for data artifacts, JSON content
serialized as bytes for metrics and configs — while `FILE_REF` artifacts store path references to
files on disk. Workers stage results as Parquet files during execution, and the
orchestrator commits them atomically to the Delta tables.

```python
import polars as pl

# Read the artifact index — every artifact in the pipeline
df = pl.read_delta(str(delta_root / "artifacts" / "index"))
```
