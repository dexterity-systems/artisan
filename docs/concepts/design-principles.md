# Design Principles

Artisan's architecture is shaped by a small set of design principles. These
are not aspirational statements — they are constraints that guided concrete
decisions throughout the framework. Understanding them helps you predict how the
system behaves, why the APIs look the way they do, and where to look when
something surprises you.

## The problem space

Computational research pipelines share a pattern of failure modes:

- **Lost provenance.** Tracing a result back to its inputs means reconstructing
  a chain of scripts, log files, and ad hoc naming conventions. One missing link
  breaks the chain.
- **Scattered results.** Output files live on cluster nodes, local disks, and
  shared filesystems with no central index. Finding what ran and what it produced
  requires archaeology.
- **Fragile glue code.** Pipelines assembled from shell scripts break when
  moving between environments, when tool versions change, or when someone
  renames a directory.
- **Infrastructure as a tax.** Researchers spend more time managing job
  schedulers, file formats, and filesystem edge cases than doing the research
  the pipeline exists to support.
- **Silent data corruption.** Concurrent writes, missing fsync calls, and
  partial failures corrupt shared state in ways that are difficult to detect
  and impossible to recover from.

Artisan exists to make these problems structurally impossible, not merely
unlikely. Each principle below targets one or more of these failure modes.

## Content is identity

Every artifact is identified by the hash of its content
(`artifact_id = xxh3_128(content)`), producing a 32-character hexadecimal
string. The ID *is* the data. There is no separate registry mapping names to
values, no auto-incrementing counter, no UUID that could accidentally refer to
different content on two machines.

Content addressing extends beyond artifact storage. Execution cache keys use
the same hashing approach: `compute_execution_spec_id` hashes the operation
name, deduplicated and sorted input artifact IDs, canonicalized parameters, and
config overrides into a single deterministic key. Step-level cache keys (`compute_step_spec_id`)
work the same way but reference upstream step spec IDs instead of resolved
artifact IDs, enabling cache lookups before individual artifacts are known.

**What this buys you:**

- **Automatic deduplication.** Same content, same ID — stored once regardless
  of how many pipeline steps produce it.
- **Deterministic caching.** Cache keys are derived from content hashes of
  inputs plus operation parameters. No manual invalidation. Different inputs
  produce different keys automatically.
- **Immutability by construction.** Changing an artifact's content changes its
  ID, which means the original artifact still exists. You cannot silently
  overwrite prior results.

Artifacts follow a draft/finalize lifecycle: drafts have `artifact_id=None`
and are mutable; calling `finalize()` hashes the content, sets the ID, and
makes the artifact semantically immutable. This two-phase design lets operations
build outputs incrementally without computing hashes until the content is
complete.

**The trade-off:** Content-addressed storage makes updates expensive. You don't
"edit" an artifact — you create a new one. This is intentional. In research
pipelines, the ability to trace exactly what was computed outweighs the cost of
storing a new copy.

**See:** [Artifacts and Content Addressing](artifacts-and-content-addressing.md)
for how hashing, draft/finalize, and artifact types work in practice.

## Provenance is always captured, never reconstructed

The framework records two complementary provenance graphs at execution time,
stored in separate Delta Lake tables. Neither can be derived from the other,
and neither is optional.

**Execution provenance** (the `execution_edges` table) records which computation
consumed and produced which artifacts. Each edge links an `execution_run_id` to
an `artifact_id` with a direction (input or output) and a role name. This is an
activity log — it answers "what happened?"

**Artifact provenance** (the `artifact_edges` table) records which input
artifact produced which output artifact. Each edge carries source and target
artifact IDs, their types and roles, the execution that established the edge,
and an optional `group_id` for multi-input operations. This is a derivation
graph — it answers "where did this come from?"

For multi-input operations, edges sharing the same `group_id` and target
artifact were co-inputs to a single derivation. This lets you reconstruct
which specific combination of inputs produced a given output, not
only that they were all present in the same batch.

**Why capture at execution time?** Because the context needed to establish
derivation edges — filename stems, pairing order, explicit declarations — is
available only during execution. The framework captures lineage automatically
via filename stem matching: it strips file extensions from output names and
matches them against input stems using longest-prefix lookup. Operations with
non-standard naming provide explicit lineage declarations through
`infer_lineage_from` on their output specs.

**The trade-off:** Capturing provenance adds work to every operation. The
framework handles most of it automatically via stem matching, but operations
with non-standard naming need explicit declarations. The cost of annotating
lineage is far lower than the cost of not having it.

**See:** [Provenance System](provenance-system.md) for the dual system, stem
matching algorithm, and lineage declaration.

## Creator operations are pure computation

Creator operations — the primary operation type — know nothing about
orchestration, scheduling, storage, or infrastructure. They receive data in,
produce data out. All coordination — dispatching to workers, managing sandboxes,
staging results, committing to storage — is handled by the layers above.

The framework enforces this through the three-phase creator lifecycle:

- **Preprocess** receives artifacts and produces a plain dict of prepared inputs.
- **Execute** receives that dict plus a working directory and returns a result.
- **Postprocess** receives file outputs and the return value and constructs
  draft artifacts.

At no point does the operation touch the artifact store, the cache, or the
pipeline definition. The `ExecuteInput` provided to `execute()` contains the
prepared inputs dict, an `execute_dir` path for file I/O, a `log_path`
for tool output, and a `metadata` dict for engine-provided context.

**Why this matters:**

- **Testable in isolation.** You can unit test a creator by constructing inputs
  directly, without running a pipeline or connecting to storage.
- **Portable.** The same operation runs unchanged on a laptop with a process
  pool or on a cluster with SLURM.
- **Composable.** Operations can be combined freely because they have no hidden
  dependencies on each other or on global state. The composite executor passes
  artifacts between operations in memory without Delta Lake round-trips, which
  is only possible because operations have no side channels.

**The exception — curator operations:** Curators are a second operation type
that intentionally breaks this boundary. They receive an `ArtifactStore` and
can query or filter across the full artifact collection. This is a deliberate
trade-off: curators need storage access to perform collection-level operations
like filtering, merging, and ingestion. The purity guarantee applies to
creators, which make up the majority of pipeline operations.

**The trade-off:** Operations cannot make infrastructure decisions. An
operation that wants to "run this part on GPU and that part on CPU" cannot
express this — resource allocation is declared statically in the operation's
`resources` config. This keeps operations simple at the cost of dynamic
scheduling flexibility.

**See:** [Operations Model](operations-model.md) for the two operation types,
three-phase lifecycle, and spec system.

## Scale is transparent

The same code path runs for one artifact on a laptop or ten thousand artifacts
on an HPC cluster. Only the compute backend changes — from `LOCAL` (process
pool) to `SLURM` (cluster job submission). Both backends build a Prefect flow
with a backend-specific task runner, then dispatch the same `ExecutionUnit`
objects through it. The backend interface is extensible, so additional backends
(cloud, Kubernetes) can be added without changing operations, execution logic,
provenance capture, or storage commits.

**Why this principle exists:** Research pipelines start as local prototypes
and grow to cluster-scale production. If different execution environments use
different code paths, bugs hide in the gap. "Works on my machine" becomes
"fails on the cluster" and vice versa. A pipeline that behaves differently
depending on where it runs is a pipeline you cannot trust.

**How the framework enforces it:** The orchestrator-worker split defines a
clean boundary. The orchestrator dispatches `ExecutionUnit` objects — sealed
packages containing everything a worker needs: the operation instance, input
artifact IDs, execution spec ID, and step number. Workers execute them
identically regardless of whether they are processes in a local pool or SLURM
jobs on remote nodes. The staging-commit pattern ensures that results are
collected the same way in all cases.

Each backend declares two trait objects that capture the behavioral
differences:

- **Worker traits** control I/O behavior on the worker (e.g., whether to fsync
  staged files for NFS visibility).
- **Orchestrator traits** control post-dispatch behavior (e.g., whether to poll
  for staging file visibility on shared filesystems).

These traits are the only places where backend-specific logic lives. Everything
else is shared.

**The trade-off:** Uniformity means the local execution path carries some
overhead (sandbox directories, staged Parquet files) that a local-only system
would skip. This overhead is negligible in practice because operations dominate
runtime, but it means "run this one thing quickly" still goes through the full
lifecycle.

**See:** [Execution Flow](execution-flow.md) for the dispatch-execute-commit
phases and [Architecture Overview](architecture-overview.md) for the
orchestrator-worker split.

## Shared state is never mutated concurrently

Workers never write to Delta Lake directly. Instead, each worker writes
results to an isolated staging directory, and the orchestrator commits them
after all workers complete. Each Delta table is committed independently in a
fixed order — content tables first, then the artifact index, then artifact
edges, then execution edges, then executions — to minimize referential
integrity issues on partial failure. No optimistic concurrency, no write
conflicts.

Content-addressed deduplication runs at commit time: before appending rows,
the committer filters out any `artifact_id` values that already exist in the
target table. This makes commits idempotent — if a crash interrupts a commit
and the orchestrator retries, duplicate rows are silently dropped. The
`recover_staged` method exploits this property to commit leftover staging files
from a prior crashed run.

**Why this principle exists:** Pipelines run thousands of concurrent workers.
If each worker wrote directly to shared tables, write conflicts would be
frequent and data corruption would be a matter of time.

**The trade-off:** Serialized commits mean all results for a step must be
collected before any are committed. You cannot query intermediate results
while a step is still running. This is the cost of consistency: you always
see a complete, correct snapshot or nothing at all.

**See:** [Storage and Delta Lake](storage-and-delta-lake.md#the-staging-commit-pattern)
for the full staging-commit pattern.

## Layers depend downward only

The framework is organized into five layers — schemas, operations, storage,
execution, orchestration — with strict downward-only dependencies. Each layer
can be used without the ones above it.

```
orchestration  →  execution  →  operations  →  schemas
                      ↓
                   storage   →  schemas
```

**Why layering matters:**

- **Testing.** You can test operations without orchestration, execution without
  SLURM, and schemas without anything else.
- **Change isolation.** Modifying the orchestration layer cannot break
  operations. Adding a new artifact type (schemas) does not require changes
  to execution or orchestration.
- **Flexible composition.** Use the execution layer directly for one-off
  computation. Use operations with a different orchestrator. Each layer is a
  stable building block.

**The trade-off:** Strict layering occasionally means information cannot flow
where it would be convenient. An operation cannot check whether it is running
in a cached context, and the execution layer cannot influence dispatch
decisions. These restrictions keep the architecture clean at the cost of
some workarounds in specific scenarios.

**See:** [Architecture Overview](architecture-overview.md) for the full layer
diagram and dependency table.

## Fail fast, fail loud

The framework validates as much as possible before execution begins: input
types, spec compatibility, parameter schemas, step wiring. When an error does
occur at runtime, it propagates immediately with context — which operation,
which artifact, which phase — rather than being swallowed or deferred.

**Why this matters:** In a pipeline that takes hours to run, discovering an
error in step 8 that could have been caught at step 1 is a waste of compute
time and researcher attention. Early validation turns runtime surprises into
immediate, actionable errors.

**Examples of fail-fast behavior:**

- Operations that implement neither `execute` nor `execute_curator` raise
  `TypeError` at class definition time.
- Creator operations must declare `infer_lineage_from` on every output spec.
  Missing declarations are rejected at class definition, not at pipeline
  runtime.
- Creator operations with inputs must implement `preprocess`. Omitting it
  raises `TypeError` at class definition.
- `OutputRole` and `InputRole` enums must match the `outputs` and `inputs`
  dicts exactly. Mismatches are caught at class definition.
- Empty `infer_lineage_from = {}` is rejected as ambiguous intent — you must
  choose `{"inputs": [...]}` for declared lineage or `{"inputs": []}` for
  generative operations.
- Combined `{"inputs": [...], "outputs": [...]}` lineage patterns are rejected;
  use separate output roles instead.
- `ExecutionUnit` validates that all artifact IDs are 32-character hex strings
  and that all input roles have consistent batch sizes (unless the operation
  declares `independent_input_streams`).
- `ArtifactTypes.ANY` on a concrete artifact raises `ValueError` — `ANY` is
  a spec-only sentinel, not a valid artifact type.

**The trade-off:** Strict validation can be frustrating during exploration,
when you want to sketch a pipeline before all the pieces are ready. The
framework prioritizes correctness over flexibility in this regard.

**See:** [Error Handling](error-handling.md) for the error propagation model
and how the framework handles runtime failures after validation passes.

## Principles in tension

These principles occasionally pull in different directions. When they do,
the framework resolves the tension by prioritizing in this order:

- **Correctness** (provenance, content addressing, serialized commits)
- **Reproducibility** (deterministic caching, immutable artifacts)
- **Simplicity** (pure operations, layered architecture)
- **Performance** (batching, caching, scale transparency)

An example: content-addressed storage means the framework hashes every artifact,
which has a cost. But this cost is paid to guarantee that cache keys are correct
(correctness) and that identical results are never recomputed (reproducibility).
Performance is optimized within the constraints of correctness, not at its
expense.
