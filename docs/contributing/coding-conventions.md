# Coding Conventions

Standards and patterns for contributing code to the Artisan framework.

---

## Directory Naming

- All directories use **lowercase snake_case**
- Directory names are **nouns describing a responsibility**, not verbs:

```
execution/context/    # not "building_context"
execution/lineage/    # not "track_lineage"
storage/cache/        # not "caching"
```

## File Naming

- All files are `snake_case.py`
- **One primary class per file**, file named after the class:

```
storage/core/artifact_store.py  → ArtifactStore
schemas/specs/input_spec.py     → InputSpec
operations/curator/filter.py    → Filter
```

### Tightly coupled classes share a file

When classes form a logical unit (variants, a type hierarchy, or a union),
they go in one file:

```
schemas/operation_config/environment_spec.py
  → EnvironmentSpec, LocalEnvironmentSpec, DockerEnvironmentSpec, ApptainerEnvironmentSpec, PixiEnvironmentSpec

schemas/execution/curator_result.py
  → ArtifactResult, PassthroughResult, CuratorResult

operations/examples/data_generator.py
  → DataGenerator (with nested Params, InputRole/OutputRole enums)
```

The rule: **if the classes only make sense together, keep them together.**

### Reserved file names

| Name | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `base.py` | Base class for the package | `schemas/artifact/base.py` → `Artifact` |
| `utils.py` | Helper functions for the package | `execution/utils.py` |
| `shared.py` | Code shared between variant operations | (variant operations sharing logic) |
| `constants.py` | Package-level constants | `orchestration/engine/constants.py` |
| `exceptions.py` | Package-level exception classes | `execution/exceptions.py` |
| `enums.py` | Enum definitions (one file for all enums) | `schemas/enums.py` |
| `common.py` | Shared types within a sub-package | `schemas/artifact/common.py` |

## Flat vs. Nested Packages

This is the most important structural decision.

**Use flat** when:
- Files are **independent peers** — each stands alone, none depend on siblings
- Files share a package only because they share a **category** (all metrics, all
  curator ops)
- The package has **~6 or fewer files**

```
operations/metrics/
├── __init__.py
├── component_interface.py
├── sample_interface.py
└── summary_metrics.py
```

**Use nested** when:
- Files need to be **grouped by sub-responsibility** (lineage has builder +
  capture + enrich + validation)
- A group of 2+ files forms a **cohesive unit** with internal dependencies
- The flat alternative would put **10+ files** in one directory

```
execution/
├── __init__.py
├── exceptions.py        ← package-level, used across sub-packages
├── utils.py             ← package-level, used across sub-packages
├── context/
├── executors/
├── inputs/
├── lineage/
├── models/
└── staging/
```

**The heuristic:** If you can describe the package as "a collection of
independent X", keep it flat. If you need sub-groups to explain what's inside,
nest it.

### Package-level files in nested packages

Nested packages can have files at the root level for cross-cutting concerns
(`exceptions.py`, `utils.py`). These are for things that don't belong to any
one sub-package but are used across several.

## The `__init__.py` Contract

Every package's `__init__.py` must contain three things:

1. **Docstring** — what this package provides
2. **Re-exports** — import public symbols from internal modules
3. **`__all__`** — explicit list of public symbols

```python
"""Artisan curator operations: Filter, Merge, Ingest, InteractiveFilter."""

from __future__ import annotations

from artisan.operations.curator.filter import Filter
from artisan.operations.curator.ingest_data import IngestData
from artisan.operations.curator.ingest_files import IngestFiles
from artisan.operations.curator.ingest_pipeline_step import IngestPipelineStep
from artisan.operations.curator.interactive_filter import InteractiveFilter
from artisan.operations.curator.merge import Merge

__all__ = [
    "Filter",
    "IngestData",
    "IngestFiles",
    "IngestPipelineStep",
    "InteractiveFilter",
    "Merge",
]
```

### Re-export depth

| Package level | Re-exports | Example |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| Leaf | Own public classes | `operations/curator/` re-exports `Filter`, `Merge`, etc. |
| Mid-level hub | Everything from all children | `schemas/` re-exports all artifacts, specs, configs |
| Root (`artisan/`) | Top-level public API | Users import from sub-packages or root |

The mid-level hub pattern means users can write
`from artisan.schemas import DataArtifact` instead of reaching into
`schemas.artifact.data`. When adding a new type, you must add re-exports
to both the leaf `__init__.py` and the hub `__init__.py`.

## Domain Operation Package Structure

Each external tool gets its own package under `operations/`. The internal
structure scales with complexity:

| Scenario | Structure |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 operation, no heavy utils | Main file only (operation + nested Params in one file) |
| 1 operation, heavy utils (100+ lines) | Main file + `utils.py` |
| 2+ operations sharing logic | One file per operation + `shared.py` + optional `utils.py` |
| Operation + config generator | Separate files: `my_op.py` + `my_op_config.py` |

Naming patterns:
- `my_tool.py` — the simple/base variant uses the tool name
- `conditional.py`, `unconditional.py` — variants named by what differentiates them
- `my_tool_config.py` — config generators get a `_config` suffix

See [Writing Creator Operations](../how-to-guides/writing-creator-operations.md)
for concrete examples.

## Schema Sub-packages

Schemas are grouped by **what domain they describe**, not by how they are
consumed:

| Sub-package | Question it answers | Content |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| `artifact/` | "What is the data?" | Artifact type definitions |
| `composites/` | "What's the composite?" | CompositeRef and related models |
| `execution/` | "How did it run?" | Runtime state, records, results |
| `operation_config/` | "How should it run?" | Command specs, resource specs |
| `orchestration/` | "What's the plan?" | Pipeline config, step results, step state |
| `provenance/` | "Where did it come from?" | Lineage mappings, edges |
| `specs/` | "What's the contract?" | Input/output specs, phase models |

Inside each sub-package, files are flat — one model per file. Schema files are
small (typically 20–170 lines).

## Execution Sub-packages

The `execution/` package is split into sub-packages by responsibility. Each
sub-package owns a distinct phase of the worker-side execution flow:

| Sub-package | Responsibility | Key modules |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| `executors/` | Orchestrate creator, curator, and composite flows end-to-end | `creator.py`, `curator.py`, `composite.py` |
| `context/` | Build execution context, run identity, sandbox environment | `builder.py`, `sandbox.py` |
| `inputs/` | Instantiate, materialize, and group artifacts for execution | `instantiation.py`, `materialization.py`, `grouping.py`, `lineage_matching.py` |
| `lineage/` | Capture lineage, build provenance edges, validate completeness | `builder.py`, `capture.py`, `enrich.py`, `validation.py` |
| `models/` | Transport containers carrying work from orchestrator to executor | `execution_unit.py`, `execution_composite.py`, `artifact_source.py` |
| `staging/` | Stage artifacts and metadata, record outcomes | `parquet_writer.py`, `recorder.py` |

The package also has root-level cross-cutting files: `exceptions.py` and
`utils.py`.

## Dependency Direction

A file's location in the package tree determines what it may import.
Dependencies flow strictly downward:

| Package | Can import from |
|---------|----------------|
| `utils/` | stdlib, third-party only |
| `schemas/` | `utils/`, other schemas |
| `operations/` | `schemas/`, `utils/` |
| `execution/` | `operations/`, `schemas/`, `utils/`, `storage/` |
| `storage/` | `schemas/`, `utils/` |
| `orchestration/` | All lower layers |

See [Architecture Overview](../concepts/architecture-overview.md#five-layers)
for the full diagram.

### Import boundaries

When importing across packages, prefer importing from the package's
re-exports (`__init__.py`). Each package's `__all__` defines its public API.

```python
# Cross-package imports — use re-exports
from artisan.schemas import DataArtifact, ArtifactResult, InputSpec, OutputSpec
from artisan.operations.curator import Filter
from artisan.execution.executors import run_creator_flow

# Avoid reaching past the boundary for cross-package imports
from artisan.schemas.artifact.data import DataArtifact          # internal path
from artisan.execution.lineage.capture import _match_outputs_to_candidates  # private
```

**Within a package**, direct imports from sibling modules are expected. For
example, `execution/executors/creator.py` imports directly from
`execution/lineage/capture.py` and `execution/staging/recorder.py`. This is
normal — the `__init__.py` boundary matters for external consumers, not for
internal wiring.

## Where Does New Code Go?

| I'm adding... | Put it in | Structure |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| A new domain operation | `operations/<tool_name>/` | Package with `__init__.py`, main file, optional `utils.py` |
| A new curator operation | `operations/curator/<name>.py` | Single file, flat alongside siblings |
| A new example operation | `operations/examples/<name>.py` | Single file + re-export in `examples/__init__.py` |
| A new artifact type | `schemas/artifact/<name>.py` | Single file + re-exports in `artifact/__init__.py` and `schemas/__init__.py` |
| A new enum value | `schemas/enums.py` | Add to existing enum class |
| A new enum type | `schemas/enums.py` | New class in same file |
| A new execution concern | `execution/<existing_subpackage>/` | File in the sub-package that owns the responsibility |
| A new orchestration backend | `orchestration/backends/<name>.py` | Subclass of `BackendBase` + register in `backends/__init__.py` |
| A shared utility function | `utils/<topic>.py` | New file or add to existing file by topic, add re-export |
| A helper used by one operation only | `operations/<tool>/utils.py` | Inside the operation's own package |

## Naming

- **Classes**: `PascalCase` — `ArtifactStore`, `ExecutionUnit`, `DataTransformer`
- **Functions/methods**: `snake_case` — `compute_artifact_id`, `run_external_command`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` — `DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE`
- **Test functions**: `test_<function>_<scenario>` — `test_filter_empty_input`

## Type Hints

Type hints are required on all function signatures:

```python
def compute_artifact_id(content: bytes, artifact_type: str) -> str:
    ...
```

## Operations

- Operations declare `inputs` and `outputs` as `ClassVar` with explicit
  `InputSpec` / `OutputSpec`
- The `name` class variable identifies the operation for registry lookup
- Creator operations implement the three-phase lifecycle:
  `preprocess` → `execute` → `postprocess`
- Curator operations implement `execute_curator`
- Creator operations with inputs must implement `preprocess`
- Creator operations must set `infer_lineage_from` on every `OutputSpec`

### Role enums

Operations with inputs must define an `InputRole(StrEnum)` whose values match
the `inputs` dict keys. Operations with outputs must define an
`OutputRole(StrEnum)` matching the `outputs` dict keys. Subclass validation
enforces this at class definition time.

```python
class InputRole(StrEnum):
    DATASET = "dataset"

inputs: ClassVar[dict[str, InputSpec]] = {
    InputRole.DATASET: InputSpec(artifact_type="data", required=True),
}

class OutputRole(StrEnum):
    DATASET = "dataset"

outputs: ClassVar[dict[str, OutputSpec]] = {
    OutputRole.DATASET: OutputSpec(
        artifact_type="data",
        infer_lineage_from={"inputs": ["dataset"]},
    ),
}
```

Generative operations (no inputs) skip `InputRole`.

### Parameters

Algorithm-specific configuration uses a nested `Params(BaseModel)` class with
Pydantic `Field` annotations for validation and documentation:

```python
class Params(BaseModel):
    """Algorithm parameters for MyOperation."""

    scale_factor: float = Field(default=1.0, ge=0.0, description="...")
    seed: int | None = Field(default=None, description="...")

params: Params = Params()
```

Users override parameters at pipeline construction time. The framework
serializes `params` for caching and provenance recording.

## Error Handling

General rules:

- **Fail fast** — validate inputs early, raise clear exceptions
- Use **specific exception types** — no bare `except:`
- Include context in error messages (artifact IDs, step numbers, operation names)

For the design rationale behind these patterns, see
[Error Handling Concepts](../concepts/error-handling.md).

### The worker catch pattern

Every worker entry point (`run_creator_flow`, `run_curator_flow`) follows
the same structure: run the lifecycle inside a try/except, then record success
or failure:

```python
def run_creator_flow(unit, runtime_env, worker_id=0) -> StagingResult:
    execution_run_id = generate_execution_run_id(...)
    try:
        # Lifecycle: setup → preprocess → execute → postprocess → lineage
        lifecycle_result = run_creator_lifecycle(unit, runtime_env, worker_id, ...)

        # Record phase: stage results to parquet
        return record_execution_success(...)

    except (_PostprocessFailure, _ExecuteFailure) as exc:
        # Lifecycle failures with clean error messages
        return record_execution_failure(
            execution_context=...,
            error=str(exc),
            inputs=...,
        )
    except Exception as exc:
        # Unexpected failures — attempt to build context and record
        error = format_error(exc)
        execution_context = _try_build_execution_context(...)
        if execution_context is None:
            # Setup itself failed — return a bare StagingResult
            return StagingResult(success=False, error=error, ...)
        return record_execution_failure(...)
```

The pattern has two catch layers: typed exceptions for expected lifecycle
failures, and a general catch for unexpected errors. If even building the
execution context fails, a bare `StagingResult` is returned.

### The dispatch catch pattern

The dispatch layer wraps each worker call so the Prefect task never raises.
It also routes between creator, curator, and composite executors:

```python
@task
def execute_unit_task(unit, runtime_env):
    try:
        if isinstance(unit, ExecutionComposite):
            result = run_composite(unit, runtime_env, worker_id=...)
        elif is_curator_operation(unit.operation):
            result = run_curator_flow(unit, runtime_env, worker_id=...)
        else:
            result = run_creator_flow(unit, runtime_env, worker_id=...)
        return {"success": result.success, "error": result.error, ...}
    except Exception as exc:
        return {"success": False, "error": format_error(exc), ...}
```

### The futures collection pattern

When collecting results from parallel workers, never let one failure discard
the others:

```python
# Bad: one failure loses everything
return [f.result() for f in futures]

# Good: each future handled independently
results = []
for f in futures:
    try:
        results.append(f.result())
    except Exception as exc:
        logger.error("Future raised during result collection: %s: %s", type(exc).__name__, exc)
        results.append({"success": False, "error": format_error(exc), ...})
return results
```

### The double-fault principle

When the failure-recording mechanism itself fails, preserve the original
error. The priority order:

1. **Return a structured result** — the caller always gets a `StagingResult`
2. **Preserve the original error message** — never lose why the operation failed
3. **Persist to disk** — write the failure record to Parquet

If (3) fails, (1) and (2) still succeed. This shows up in the worker catch
pattern above: when `_try_build_execution_context` returns `None`, a bare
`StagingResult(success=False, error=error, ...)` is returned without staging.

### The batch continuation pattern

In batched execution (`units_per_worker > 1`), one item failure must not kill
the batch:

```python
results = []
for i, item in enumerate(batch_items):
    try:
        result = execute(item)
        results.append(result)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error("Item %s/%s failed: %s", i + 1, len(batch_items), e)
        results.append({"success": False, "error": format_error(e), ...})
# All items processed, all results collected
return results
```

### Guidance for operation authors

Operation authors (people writing `OperationDefinition` subclasses) do not
need to implement any of the patterns above. The framework handles all error
conversion and recording. Operations should:

- **Raise exceptions normally** when something goes wrong. The framework
  catches them via `format_error()` and records a structured failure.
- **Return `ArtifactResult(success=False, error="...")`** from `postprocess`
  or `execute_curator` for expected, recoverable failures (e.g., "no valid
  output produced"). This avoids exception overhead for anticipated outcomes.
- **Not catch-and-swallow exceptions.** If an operation catches an exception,
  it should either handle it meaningfully or re-raise. Silently ignoring
  errors defeats the recording system.

## Code Style

- **Functions < 30 lines** ideally
- **Comments explain "why"**, not "what"
- **DRY, YAGNI, KISS** — no premature abstractions
- **No backwards-compat shims** — when removing or renaming, delete completely
- Formatting enforced by **Ruff** (`pixi run -e dev fmt`)

## Docstrings (Google Style)

```python
def get_artifact(
    self,
    artifact_id: str,
    artifact_type: str,
) -> Artifact:
    """Retrieve a single artifact by ID and type.

    Args:
        artifact_id: Content-addressed artifact identifier.
        artifact_type: Expected type ("data", "metric", etc.).

    Returns:
        The hydrated artifact with content loaded.

    Raises:
        KeyError: If the artifact does not exist.
        TypeError: If the artifact type does not match.
    """
```

## Testing

- Cover: happy path, edge cases, error conditions
- Use `@pytest.mark.integration` for integration tests
- Integration tests live in `tests/integration/` and run in parallel
- Test functions: `test_<function>_<scenario>`
- Tests mirror source structure: `tests/artisan/{module}/test_<file>.py`

## Imports

- Standard library first, then third-party, then local — enforced by Ruff
- Prefer explicit imports over `from module import *`
- Use relative imports within a package only when necessary
