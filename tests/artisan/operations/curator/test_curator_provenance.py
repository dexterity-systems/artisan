"""Tests for curator operations provenance behavior.

This module verifies that curator operations (Merge, Filter) have the
correct provenance behavior as documented in design_provenance_phase5_operations.md.

Summary of expected behavior:
- Merge: No provenance edges - passthrough semantics (artifacts unchanged)
- Filter: No provenance edges - selection semantics (artifacts unchanged)
